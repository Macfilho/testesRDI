Problem #1
The operation called right circular rotation on an array of integers consists of moving the last array
element to the first position and shifting all remaining elements right one. Given an array of integers,
perform the rotation operation a number of times.
For each array, perform a number of right circular rotations and return this array.
For example, array a = [3, 4, 5], number of rotations k = 2.
First we perform the two rotations:
[3, 4, 5] รฐ [5, 3, 4] รฐ [4, 5, 3]
The result of that would be [4, 5, 3]
Explanation
Given the array [1, 2, 3] after the first rotation, the array becomes [3, 1, 2].
After the second (and final) rotation, the array becomes [2, 3, 1].
